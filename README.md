# Structural_Variance_logFiles
LogFiles for Bioinformatics tools for structural variance

There are many bioinformatics tools for structural variance. Many of them are difficult to install. I have created logFiles for a number of them, with Errors, troubleshooting, and method of Installation.

Please use this to help yourselves install these tools, and if you have successfully installed some of the tools that I have failed to install, I would appreciate some methodology.
